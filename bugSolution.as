The issue might stem from asynchronous operations or improper variable scoping, particularly when dealing with event listeners or callbacks. To correct this, ensure that `someVariable` is properly defined and accessible within the scope of `someFunction`. If `someVariable`'s lifecycle is tied to an external event, you may need to verify it's initialized and ready before access in `someFunction`:

```actionscript
import flash.events.Event;

function someFunction(e:Event = null):void {
  if (someVariable != null) { //Explicit null check
    trace(someVariable);
  } else {
    trace("someVariable is null. Check initialization.");
  }
}

// Example with event listener: ensure someVariable is set before calling someFunction
myObject.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, someFunction);

// ... code to set someVariable within the event listener or before adding the listener...

// Alternative: use a conditional check to ensure variable existence
function someFunction():void {
    if (this.hasOwnProperty("someVariable")){
      trace(someVariable);
    } else {
        trace("someVariable not found on this object.");
    }
}
```

This approach introduces explicit null checks or alternative checks to prevent the runtime error. Consider reviewing the lifecycle of `someVariable` and its timing relationship to the function where it's used.
